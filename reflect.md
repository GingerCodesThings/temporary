# Reflection on Git

**Summary:** Git is a helpful version control system that allows multiple users to access and upload their work on a repository while keeping changes from all users.

**Benefits of Git:**

- Allows you to work on a project from multiple devices
- Allows multiple users to access the same project
- Allows you to branch off of the main project and create new code before committing it to the main project
- Allows you to monitor changes to the project
- Allows you to revert to previous versions of the project

## My personal thoughts on git

 I think git is something I should have learned years ago, and I can see so many different times where it would've been so helpful to have known git and be able to use it. I remember in highschool, I had a website final project, and I had to manually upload my entire website at the end of every class to Google Drive so that I could work on it at home, and before I went to sleep that night I had to reupload the project again to my drive, and download it onto the school computer during class the next day. Had I been able to use git it would've saved me so much time. Not only is this a useful tool for someone like me who works on multiple devices, I can see it's application on a shared project. One of my friends had all the same web development classes with me at my highschool, and we both loved making websites and having those classes together, but we never were able to work on anything together. One time we started to work on a joke website, but it was hard to work with the files. Using git would've completely changed how we worked on even a gag website. I can see it being incredibly useful for developers working on real projects.
